    <h1>Privacy Policy for Chrome Extension</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025/03/10</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for using <strong>Trello Helper</strong> ("the Extension"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The Extension does not collect, store, or share any personal data from users. It operates by detecting click data on the Trello.com website to trigger actions within the extension but does not transmit, retain, or process any personal information.</p>
    
    <h2>2. How We Use Click Data</h2>
    <p>The Extension monitors user interactions (clicks) on Trello.com to provide enhanced functionality. However, this data is used <strong>only locally</strong> on the user's device and is not sent to any external servers or third parties.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Data Storage and Sharing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Data Storage:</strong> The Extension does not store any user data.</li>
        <li><strong>No Data Sharing:</strong> We do not sell, trade, or share any information with third parties.</li>
        <li><strong>No External Servers:</strong> The Extension operates entirely within the browser environment without transmitting data externally.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>To function properly, the Extension requires permission to access Trello.com. These permissions are solely used to detect click events and enhance the user experience within Trello.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>Since no personal data is collected or stored, security risks related to data breaches are minimized. The Extension is designed to respect user privacy and maintain a secure browsing experience.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes occur, we will update the Effective Date at the top of this document.</p>
